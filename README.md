# Jobsity - Challenge
This is an Application for Jobsity Challenge that serves to read a file with players rolls and then calculate and show the result of the game 

## Running the project
- Compile project with: mvn clean install
- Run the jar file: java -jar 1.0.0-BowlingGame.jar <FILE_PATH>
- The File Path parameter is required to execute the program. It can be full path or relative path (in this case file must be in the same folder to work).
