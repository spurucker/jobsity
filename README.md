# Jobsity - Challenge
This is an Application for Jobsity Challenge that serves to read a file with players rolls and then calculate and show the result of the game 

## Running the project
- Compile project with: mvn clean install
- Run the jar file: java -jar 1.0.0-BowlingGame.jar <FILE_PATH>
- The File Path parameter is required to execute the program. It can be full path or relative path (in this case file must be in the same folder to work).
- The file input.txt is added in the repository to use as an example. In test/resources can be found more examples.


## Notes
- Code is formatted using Google Java Format standard.
- It was required that the output would be separated by tabs. I changed this for fixed strings that would fill the empty spaces with '-'. This change was made as it was more clear to understand the result. If required I can change them for tabs.
